                            In 1925, there were about 8 light bulb manufacturers who together controlled all the light bulbs flowing out of stores.

                            consumers have to purchase? That will double the revenue that we bring in. The 8 companies collaborated to launch their
                            new plan, and sure enough, it worked. In fiscal year 1926â€“27, 335.7 million light bulbs were sold worldwide. Four years

                            Planned obsolescence, in a nutshell, is when <strong>products are intentionally built to be worse quality.</strong> At
                            that time, a standard quality light bulb had a lifespan of about 2500 hours. Manufacturers decided to all agree to
                            manufacture bulbs that are built to last 1000 hoursâ€”less than half the standard lifespan. Now, consumers ran out of
                            light bulbs more than 2x faster, giving them the need to visit the light bulb store 2x more often and buy 2x as much
                            bulbs, meaning 2x as much revenue on average for each of the companies involved in this contract.

                            Most consumers wouldn&#x27;t find out about this. The ones that did were left powerless - because every single light
                            bulb in stores was produced by one of these eight manufacturers, consumers who didn&#x27;t like the 1000 hour light
                            bulbs could not get better quality light bulbs anywhere else.

                                cherished free market that I had grown used to. The essence of capitalism is that producers try to make the best
                                quality product that they can, and consumers will pick the product that is the highest quality with the lowest
                                price, forcing producers to compete with each other to make the best product possible. Through{" "}
                                <em>natural selection</em>, with companies that appeal to consumers living on to reproduce and companies who failed
                                to do so dying, the products that eventually succeed are the ones that consumers like the best. Capitalism is
                                supposed to cause the best products to surface to the top, which is beneficial for consumers (the products consumers
                                can purchase just keep getting better and better over time).

                                Planned obsolescence completely violates all that. When mega-corporations get together to agree to shorten the
                                lifespan of a light bulb, they get successful because they intentionally produced a <strong>worse</strong> quality
                                product without lowering the price. Furthermore, consumers are the one who lose in this situation: having to pay
                                more than 2 times more for the same product. The free market fails at one of its core purposes: bringing out the
                                best products for the consumers.

                                Price collusion is when a few companies that control the whole market combined get together, and form an agreement
                                to raise prices. e.g. if all bread manufacturers (dumpsters, ...) decided to simultaneously double the price of
                                bread today. You don&#x27;t like the higher bread prices? Well too bad for you, every loaf of bread you find at your

                            Yup, you read that right. Apple glues their batteries to the casing of their phones and laptops so that you are unable

                            years of use. In the past, you&#x27;d just replace the battery. But now, if your battery loses its life, your whole
                            device gets chucked out. Gluing the battery to devices has probably cut the average lifespan of a device{" "}
