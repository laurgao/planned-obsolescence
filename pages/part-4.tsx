            <p>
                As we already established earlier, the problem with e-waste is that it's a systematic problem. Capitalism, gdp measurements are
                directly against the idea of buying only what you need, a crucial pillar for reducing waste. A lot of the produced so much of the
                e-waste we produce is not necessary! As illustrated by the anecdotes in part 1, the pentalobe screws, the shit you coulda fixed
                yourself but didnt.

                The problem of e-waste is not just capitalism and planned obsolescence. It&#x27;s also consumerist culture. 3 years ago, if you had
                an iPhone 7, you would be the <em>cool kid</em> in my in my className. Today, if you have an iPhone 7, you would be ostracized as a
                boomer.

                All jokes aside, the root cause of electronic waste, the production of <em>70% of the world&#x27;s toxic waste</em> is largely
                caused by human behaviour, culture, and first world problems. This is what makes this problem interesting to me. It requires a
                *different type of innovation* - a Tesla-esque innovation - one that doesn&#x27;t just shake the industry, but shapes the social
                constructs around electric cars.

                I want to do for e-waste what Elon Musk did for sustainable transport - I want to build a company that will change the perception
                around what type of phone is sexy. I want to change the norm from &quot;the latest and greatest is cool&quot; to &quot;I can repair
                my own electronics. I owned this phone for 10 years. That is cool.&quot;
