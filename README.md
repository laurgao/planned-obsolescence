# Planned obsolescence

This website is built with Next.js (a React.js framework), typescript, tailwindcss, and p5.js.

`npm i` to install packages and then `npm run dev` to view the website locally on `http://localhost:3000`.

Alternatively, if you don't have node.js or npm installed, view the website at my deployment at [https://planned-obsolescence.vercel.app/](https://planned-obsolescence.vercel.app/).
