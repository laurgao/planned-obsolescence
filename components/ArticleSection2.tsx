            Eventually, the light bulb &quot;cult&quot; did get found out. But as we got rid of one problem, more sprung up. In 2020, we&#x27;re
            seeing the same planned obsolescent behaviour from many other industries. (It&#x27;s been several decades and nothing has changed.
            Sounds like the education system.)

            Yup, you read that right. Apple glues their batteries to the casing of their phones and laptops so that you are unable to replace them.
            The battery is often the first component of an electronic device to break, usually gets bad after 3-5 years of use. In the past,
            you&#x27;d just replace the battery. But now, if your battery loses its life, your whole device gets chucked out. Gluing the battery to
            devices has probably cut the average lifespan of a device <strong>in half</strong>. (Sounds familiar? ðŸ’¡)

            As if that wasn&#x27;t enough for a profit hungry mega corp, Apple designed their own screw bit, called a pentalobe screw, to hold
            together the outer casing of their electronics, just so that people aren&#x27;t able to open their laptops or iPhones to repair it
            themselves. If you have any minor issue, you have to take it to the apple repair store because they&#x27;re the only ones with pentalobe
            screwdrivers. With the tremendous cost of repairs, you might as well just get a new phone. (a repair you could&#x27;ve done on your own
            had apple not taken part in planned obsolescent behaviour)

            Apple devices are electronics that are designed to be worse quality, while at the same time being so much more expensive. All those new
            phones you&#x27;re buying, causing your bank account to bleed dry while a trillion dollar company not satisfied with their 50 billion
            dollars of yearly profit is laughing behind their corporate suits.

            Butâ€”what&#x27;s being harmed is not just consumer&#x27;s wallets. An average American buys a new phone every 22 months. Multiply that
