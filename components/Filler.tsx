                Furthermore, recycling is horribly inefficient—it uses lots of energy and water. Recycling plants are fragile. Each item that
                arrives at a recycling plant has to be meticulously sorted <em>by human workers, </em>as mixing up plastic with metal damages

                longer be recycled. Each recycled pound of paper uses 5000 gallons of water. Sure, that&#x27;s a huge improvement from the 12 000

                Before purchasing an item, think to yourself, do I really need it? What I like to do is this: if I see something that I want to buy,
                I note it down. 3 days later, do I still want it? Often times, the answer is no. I realized that, by just waiting a few days before
                making a purchase, I&#x27;ve cut down about 90% of items that I would&#x27;ve bought otherwise. It really demonstrates how much
                impulsive purchases we tend to make: see something attractive in the store, 10 mins later you&#x27;re walking out with a receipt.

                According to a United Nations report, 82.6% of e-waste thrown out in 2019 was not recycled into a designated e-waste collection
                facility. E-waste is poisonous: regular landfills are not built against e-waste poison leaks into rivers. E-waste that burns in
                incinerators release toxins into the air. E-waste makes up 70% of the world&#x27;s toxic waste production.

                The 17.4% that does get recycled properly - well, that doesn&#x27;t end up well either. Canada and the States exports 90% of our

                in unsafe conditions, lighting up fires on their own property to melt the e-waste. This inadvertently leads to the inhalation toxic
                fumes of cadmium, mercury, and lead, which can cause these people to develop lung and kidney damage.

                All jokes aside, the root cause of electronic waste, the production of <em>70% of the world&#x27;s toxic waste</em> is largely
                caused by human behaviour, culture, and first world problems. This is what makes this problem interesting to me. It requires a
                *different type of innovation* - a Tesla-esque innovation - one that doesn&#x27;t just shake the industry, but shapes the social
                constructs around electric cars.

                There is lots of social media attention on recycling. My friends preach recycling to me when we go out to eat, making sure we throw
                out our fast food packaging in the right bin. Schools teach kids to recycle. From Grade 1 to Grade 6, my elementary school worked to
                earn these &quot;gold badges&quot; for meeting a certain quota of waste recycled.

                How it should be like, however, is reduce, reuse, recycle, <em>in that order</em>. First reduce, then reuse, and recycle only as a
                last resort when the other two cannot be used. Recycling is not the angel solution that some of my friends like to characterize it
                as. A world recycling 292.4 million tons of waste per year is still, well, producing 292.4 million tons of waste each year.

                Furthermore, recycling is horribly inefficient—it uses lots of energy and water. Recycling plants are fragile. Each item that
                arrives at a recycling plant has to be meticulously sorted <em>by human workers, </em>as mixing up plastic with metal damages
                machinery. Recycling gets easily contaminated: if one idiot throws some food into a dumpster of recycling, the whole dumpster can no
                longer be recycled. Each recycled pound of paper uses 5000 gallons of water. Sure, that&#x27;s a huge improvement from the 12 000
                gallons of water it would take to harvest a pound of paper from trees, but 5000 gallons is still a crap ton of water. What if, we
                didn&#x27;t have to use any water at all?

                That&#x27;s where reducing waste comes in. If the waste was never created in the first place, then there are no problems! No
                landfills that are stinkier than your socks. No incinerators pumping even more carbon dioxide in the air. No chemicals leaking out
                of landfills and poisoning our water. No need for &quot;banning plastic&quot; - as we have seen from the War on Drugs, cutting
                supply does not solve the problem when there is a high demand. Banning single use plastic will not solve the problem. Instead,
                change needs to emerge from the bottom up, to eradicate demand for single use plastic. That can be created via a culture of reducing
                waste.

                Reducing waste also has the added benefit of not needing the energy and resources to produce the wasted item in the first
                place—killing two birds with one stone.

                Reducing waste is the solution to the waste problem - not just in plastics, not just in electronic waste, but everywhere. An average

                There is lots of social media attention on recycling. My friends preach recycling to me when we go out to eat, making sure we throw
                out our fast food packaging in the right bin. Schools teach kids to recycle. From Grade 1 to Grade 6, my elementary school worked to
                earn these &quot;gold badges&quot; for meeting a certain quota of waste recycled.

                How it should be like, however, is reduce, reuse, recycle, <em>in that order</em>. First reduce, then reuse, and recycle only as a
                last resort when the other two cannot be used. Recycling is not the angel solution that some of my friends like to characterize it
                as. A world recycling 292.4 million tons of waste per year is still, well, producing 292.4 million tons of waste each year.
            </p>

                Furthermore, recycling is horribly inefficient—it uses lots of energy and water. Recycling plants are fragile. Each item that
                arrives at a recycling plant has to be meticulously sorted <em>by human workers, </em>as mixing up plastic with metal damages
                machinery. Recycling gets easily contaminated: if one idiot throws some food into a dumpster of recycling, the whole dumpster can no
                longer be recycled. Each recycled pound of paper uses 5000 gallons of water. Sure, that&#x27;s a huge improvement from the 12 000
                gallons of water it would take to harvest a pound of paper from trees, but 5000 gallons is still a crap ton of water. What if, we
                didn&#x27;t have to use any water at all?
            </p>

                That&#x27;s where reducing waste comes in. If the waste was never created in the first place, then there are no problems! No
                landfills that are stinkier than your socks. No incinerators pumping even more carbon dioxide in the air. No chemicals leaking out
                of landfills and poisoning our water. No need for &quot;banning plastic&quot; - as we have seen from the War on Drugs, cutting
                supply does not solve the problem when there is a high demand. Banning single use plastic will not solve the problem. Instead,
                change needs to emerge from the bottom up, to eradicate demand for single use plastic. That can be created via a culture of reducing
                waste.

                Reducing waste also has the added benefit of not needing the energy and resources to produce the wasted item in the first
                place—killing two birds with one stone.

                Reducing waste is the solution to the waste problem - not just in plastics, not just in electronic waste, but everywhere. An average

                Before purchasing an item, think to yourself, do I really need it? What I like to do is this: if I see something that I want to buy,
                I note it down. 3 days later, do I still want it? Often times, the answer is no. I realized that, by just waiting a few days before
                making a purchase, I&#x27;ve cut down about 90% of items that I would&#x27;ve bought otherwise. It really demonstrates how much
                impulsive purchases we tend to make: see something attractive in the store, 10 mins later you&#x27;re walking out with a receipt.
